# Pokémon Insight

A web‐based dashboard for exploring Pokémon data through three interactive panels:
1. **Ranking** (Panel 1) – “Top Pokémon by Type – Generational Scrollable Rankings”  
2. **Trends** (Panel 2) – “Stat Trends by Type & Generation – Dual‐Type Comparison”  
3. **TypeMap** (Panel 3) – “Team Coverage & Type Effectiveness Map”  

Additionally, there is an individual Pokémon detail page and an initial data‐analysis notebook. All files rely on a single CSV (`pokemon.csv`) containing complete data for all 801 Pokémon (Generations 1–7).
